// One-off: writes a `picker` level_events row for each player who joined a
// Megagame class on /account before the picker recorded events. Without it,
// undoing a volunteer level-up in that class would drop the player to 0, and
// the dashboard would not show the join. awarded_at is the run time, since the
// original join time was never stored.
//
// Only class columns at exactly 1 are backfilled, since the picker never set
// anything higher; columns above 1 with no events are listed for a person to
// look at. Safe to run twice: a class that already has a live event is skipped.
//
// Dry run by default. Pass --apply to write.
